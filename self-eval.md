# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?</br>
--**"Everything flowed really well. I liked some of the challenges as they were not only testing but humorous as well.</br>
I felt comfortable completing these challenges with the knowledge that I've acquired."**
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?</br>
--**"I think that I have a good pattern of working and breaks, but more importantly knowing when to take breaks so I remain</br>
focused."**
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?</br>
--**"I've noticed that I am more comfortable in a room with less light, so I'll be working on making that happen. Seating</br>
has also been an issue so I'll be looking for a solution there as well. Being more comfortable should make tackling problems</br>
more manageable."**
